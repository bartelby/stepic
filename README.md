This repo consists of programming exercises done while taking Pavel Pevsner's online Bioinformatics course
Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I).  Here is a link to the course:

The exercises are found on the Stepic web site: https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis

I am working in python.  If time permits, I will rework the exercises in Scala.
